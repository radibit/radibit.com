title: What you see is faster than what you get - ways to speed up perception
---

This May, I had the pleasure to present at [Web Performance Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Berlin-Web-Performance-Group/) in Berlin. This was a very special moment for me as it was my first public talk :blush: The following is a transcript and slides from my presentation. You can also find links to all resources I used preparing for this talk. Enjoy!

    <p>
      I'm going to talk about perceived performance, why it matters, and how we can be better at it.

			<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/707a/b6961398bb12007252c454539e42f3ce121e.pdf">The internal clock model</a> shows how our time perception depends on our memory associated with a certain stimulus. It starts by activating a pacemaker. Then in the second (memory) stage the neurons transmit the information and our brains start looking for previous experiences connected with this stimulus. Finally, we are making a decision based on the accumulated information. The time of decision making shortens considerably if we have a memory connected with the received stimulus.

			Reaction time has a been a favorite subject of experimental psychologists for almost a decade.

		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				0.1 to 0.2s Acceptable response time which simulates instantaneous behavior.
			</li>
			<li>
				0.5 to 1s Immediate behavior. Usually the response time in a human-to-human conversation. Delays within this interval are noticeable but easily tolerated by most users. During this time, the user must receive a response that their command (click of a button or link) has been accepted.
			</li>
			<li>
				2 to 5s Optimal experience as a state when people experience concentration, absolute absorption in an activity and deep enjoyment.</li>
			<li>
				5 to 10s The user would still be focused on their task but would become easily distracted. This is the time for the system to engage the user in the process. If this is not done, then the user will most probably be lost forever.

			"<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1099-0720">Studies</a> demonstrate that well implemented animations have a direct effect upon cognitive load." However, it's important to note that poorly designed or overly complex animations might have a negative impact on our apps.

			In her article <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-importance-of-context-shifting-in-ux-patterns/">"The Importance of Context-Shifting in UX Patterns"</a>, Sarah Drasner elaborates on the animation role as part of web development.
			She states, that the associations of space, time and placement can help an interaction seem more fluid and intuitive. Of course, if it's elegantly implemented it will affect positively the perceived performance of our apps.
