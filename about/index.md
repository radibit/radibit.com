Hi there, my name is Radimir Bitsov. I'm a front-end developer with a passion for web performance and accessibility.
I'm intrigued by the ability to create fast, responsive web applications and tools.

Follower of the clean, intuitive, and engaging UI / UX standards. As a self-learner
I'm looking everyday to expand and share my knowledge and skills.

I’m currently living and working in Berlin as a front-end engineer for
[Junomedical](http://www.junomedical.com/en).
Previously, I worked for [Loopline Systems](http://www.loopline-systems.com/en),
[Tumba Solutions](http://tumba.solutions/) and [ICB](http://www.icb.bg/).
