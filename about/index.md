Hi there, my name is Radimir Bitsov. I'm a front-end engineer with a passion for web performance and accessibility.
I'm intrigued by the ability to create fast, responsive web applications and tools.

Follower of the clean, intuitive, and engaging UI / UX standards. As a self-learner
I'm looking everyday to expand and share my knowledge and skills.

I’m currently living and working in Berlin as a front-end engineer for [Project A](https://www.project-a.com/en).
Previously, I worked for [Qunomedical](https://www.qunomedical.com/en/), [Loopline Systems](http://www.loopline-systems.com/en), [Tumba Solutions](http://tumba.solutions/), and [ICB](http://www.icb.bg/).
